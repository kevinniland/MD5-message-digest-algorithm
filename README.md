# MD5 Message Digest Algorithm
 _4th year Theory of Algorithms project. An application written in C that takes in a user input/file and calculates the MD5 hash digest of the user input/file._

 ### Project Statement
 _You must write a program in the C programming language that calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task Force. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm â€” you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on. I suggest you allow the user to input some free text or a filename via the command line._
